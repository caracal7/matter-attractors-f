# matter-attractors-f

This is an unofficial updated version for the original [matter-attractors plugin](https://github.com/liabru/matter-attractors) since it seems that the author would no longer update the original repo of version 0.1.6.

## Usage
Differences come when you try to install and require.

Install like:
```shell
npm install matter-attractors-f
```

Reuqire like:
```JavaScript
require('matter-attractors-f');
```

Other process and APIs are the same up to now.
